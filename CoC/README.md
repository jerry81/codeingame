Goal
Your task is to sum all values in a square above the diagonal running from the top left corner of the square to the bottom right corner.

Example: The size of square is 4.
Values in square are:
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
1 2 3 9
5 6 7 8

The numbers above the diagonal are: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9.
The sum of these numbers is 2+3+4+7+8+9 = 33.
So the output is 33.
