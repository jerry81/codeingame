SOLDIER MOVABLE SITES
Soldier movable sites are blocks where a soldier can move which based on direction where is soldier facing, for example: If soldier is facing UP then soldier can't move DOWN and can move UP, RIGHT and LEFT.

Suppose in this picture the soldier is facing UP side, Then it can move on GREEN coloured tiles and can't move on RED coloured tiles.
So, basically the soldier just can't move in the opposite direction of where it is facing.

SOLDIER ATTACKING SITES
Soldier attacking sites are blocks on which a soldier can attack which is again based on the direction soldier is facing. A soldier can attack on the blocks which are in range of distance 2 from soldier and are not in back side of direction.

Suppose in this picture the soldier is facing UP, then GREEN coloured tiles are soldier attacking sites.

And suppose in this picture the soldier is facing DOWN, then GREEN coloured tiles are soldier attacking sites.
