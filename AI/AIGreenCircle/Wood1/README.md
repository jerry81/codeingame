This challenge is inspired from the board game Samsara
 	Goal
The game takes place in a company IT department. Management is organizing a hackathon on the Green IT theme. Two development teams are competing to be the most efficient team. Release the required applications before the opponent team to have more points, but respect the Green IT requirements or you'll get drowned in the Technical Debt.
 	Rules
Each player has an IT development team. The game takes place in an office with 8 desks. The hackathon will last many turns. Each turn, the players will play one after the other.

This game is based on Deck Building. Each team will have its own deck of cards that will get bigger during the game.

Each team starts the game with 4 BONUS skill cards and 4 Technical Debt cards. Those cards will be their personal draw pile. And their personal discard pile will be reshuffled into the draw pile when it gets empty.

Deckbuilding: the player discard pile is reshuffled to create the player's draw pile
The team will get more cards and will lose some during the game.
The game space (the office)
The office is made of 8 desks. Each desk is dedicated to a specific skill

TRAINING (0)

CODING (1)

DAILY_ROUTINE (2)

TASK_PRIORITIZATION (3)

ARCHITECTURE_STUDY (4)

CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION (5)

CODE_REVIEW (6)

REFACTORING (7)

Those desks are numbered from 0 to 7. Each of those desks contains 5 skill cards at the beginning of the game.

Due to covid-19, Management enforced a one way path in the office so as not to bump into other people. You must always move in the same direction.

Applications
Each application needs some skills to be released. Applications are the same for both players. Once an application has been released, it is removed from the game for both players.

Applications will get bigger through the leagues.

A small application needs 3 sets of 2 skills (like 2 REFACTORING, 2 TRAINING and 2 CODING)

A big application needs 2 sets of 4 skills (like 4 DAILY_ROUTINE and 4 CODE_REVIEW)

Each BONUS skill card provides one good skill (any of them) and one shoddy skill.

Each specific skill card provides 2 good skills (of this specific type) and 2 shoddy skills.

For instance, a CODING card provides 2 CODING skills and 2 shoddy skills. Those shoddy skills can be used to replace any missing skill, but the quality will not be there.

Each shoddy skill used during an application release will give you a Technical Debt card. Those cards are useless. They are only here to slow you down since you can draw some from your draw pile.
Examples of how to release an application with various skills
Turn Description
At the beginning of your turn, your team draws 4 cards at random from their draw pile.

1. Move

The team begins by moving to another desk (they must leave the desk for the other team).
They will get one skill card from the desk they are moving to (TRAINING, CODE_REVIEW, REFACTORING, CODING...).
If the desk is empty (no more cards), the team will get a BONUS skill card instead.

If the team arrives on the opponent's desk (or on a desk next to the opponent), they will disturb the opponent (they are noisy when they work).
As an apology, the team must GIVE one skill card from their hand to the opponent (the team can choose which one).
If they do not have any skill card in hand, they get 2 Technical Debt cards.

2. Use a skill

After moving, the team can use one of their available skills in hand. This phase will only appear if you can play a skill. The skills and their actions:
TRAINING (0). The team draws 2 cards and can play 1 more card from their hand.
ARCHITECTURE_STUDY (4). This is a permanent skill: once played, it stays active until the team has released one application.
The team will draw one more card at the beginning of their turn. If you play many cards, their effects will add up.
CODE_REVIEW (6). The team gets 2 BONUS skill cards from the board and puts them in their discard pile.
REFACTORING (7). The team can remove a Technical Debt card from their hand and put it back on the board.
3. Release an application

The team can use their available skills in hand to RELEASE an application.
This phase will only appear if you have enough skills to do it.
Don't forget, if you use shoddy skills, you'll receive Technical Debt cards!

When you release an application, your permanent skills are discarded.

4. End of the turn

All cards in hand (skills and Technical Debt) are discarded.

Game end
The hackathon stops as soon as one team releases its 5th application.

Beware, since this hackathon is on the theme of Green IT, the referees will be paying close attention to the quality of the last released application.
The 5th application of each team cannot be released with shoddy skills!

When a team has released 5 applications, the game will end once all teams have played the same amount of turns.

The winner is the team that released the most applications.
In case of a tie, the winning team will be the one that has the less Technical Debt cards.

Victory Conditions
You released 5 applications before your opponent.
You released more applications than your opponent after 200 game phases.
In case of a tie, you have less Technical Debt cards than your opponent.
Defeat Conditions
Your program does not provide a valid command in time.
