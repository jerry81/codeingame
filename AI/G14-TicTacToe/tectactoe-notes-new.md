# shit is getting messy. let's start over?

- currently i have
  - all moves on the board as a map
  - a primitive ranking system where i favor middle moves, then corner moves
  - a simple win or loss checker
  - an outer game and inner game class

- what is needed to simulate?
  - a way to clone the game
  - a way to pick a random move
  - a way to check for win lose or draw

- need the tree
