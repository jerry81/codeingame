This is a league based challenge.

For this challenge, multiple leagues for the same game are available. Once you have proven yourself against the first Boss, you will access a higher league and extra rules will be available.

Starter AIs are available in the Starter Kit. They can help you get started with your own bot.

 	The Goal
Protect your base from monster attacks and outlive your opponent.
 	Rules
Both players controls a team of 3 heroes. The teams start out at opposite corners of the map, near their base. Throughout the game monsters will appear regularly on the edges of the map. If a monster reaches your base, it will deal damage. If your base takes too much damage, you lose.

Thankfully, your heroes can kill monsters.

The map
The game is played on a rectangular map where the coordinate X=0, Y=0 is the top-left pixel and X=17630, Y=9000 is the bottom-right pixel.

Each base can take a maximum of 3 points of damage before being destroyed.

Heroes
Every turn, you must provide a command for each hero. They may perform any of the following commands:

WAIT, the hero remains where they are.

MOVE, followed by map coordinates will make the hero advance towards that point by a maximum of 800 units.

After a hero's move phase, any monsters within 800 units will suffer 2 points of damage.

Monsters
Every monster appears with a given amount of health. If at the end of a turn, a monster's health has dropped to zero or below, the monster is removed from the game.

Monsters will appear randomly, with a random moving direction.

Monsters will always advance in a straight line at a speed of 400 units per turn.

If a monster comes within 5000 units of a base at the end of a turn, it will target that base.

When targeting a base, a monster will move directly towards that base and can no longer leave the map.

If a monster comes within 300 units of a base at the end of a turn, as long as it has not been killed on this turn, it will disappear and deal the base 1 point of damage.

Victory Conditions
Your opponent's base health has dropped to zero.
You have more base health points than your opponent after 220 turns.
Defeat Conditions
Your base's health reaches zero.
Your program does not provide a valid command in time.
