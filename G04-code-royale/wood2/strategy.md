- NOTE  new additions are tower type and giant unit type - giants break down towers 

1.  still must implement production strategy for picking knights/archers - done 
  - if no enemy knights on board - build knight - done 
  - if enemy knights on board, build archer - done 

2.  limit the buildings to one of each type - first build knight tower then archer tower 
3.  when idle, have the queen stay behind archers (keep archers between closest enemy knight and closest archer)
