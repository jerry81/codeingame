# TODO strategy 

- observation - if the enemy rushes knights at the beginning, while building the first tower, i lose lots of health 

# NOTE NEW RULES

Queen starts with less health (lowered to 55)


- trial run with existing code 

1.  fix issue - if the queen doesn't detect that the mine she just built is touching she skips away 


- lost to someone who spammed mines 

- the enemy queen is now a total dick 
- mine, mine, swords and total offense with towers near my base 
- may need to completely rework the strategy 
- definitely should expand more and adapt to opponent strategies 
- another opponent built mines with towers first and then waited until much later to build a rush of swords
