/*
	Goal
Background/terms:
• A biscuit is round (a circle)
• Measurements are in inches (not necessarily full inches)
• When a Baker has a flattened-out square of dough ("DoughSquare"), he will cut-out biscuits (in grid-style orderly columns and rows) until no more biscuits can be cut-out

The difference:
There are two types of Bakers: "Wasteful" and "Frugal":
• A Wasteful Baker will stop there, and throw away the remaining dough ☹️
• A Frugal Baker will take the remaining dough and re-form it into another (smaller) DoughSquare, and repeat the cutting process. He will continue to do this until no full-biscuit can be cut-out.

NOTE: At the end, there might be enough dough left to manually shape into a circle of the required diameter, but the Baker is not allowed to do this. In order to make a biscuit, the DoughSquare itself must be big enough so that the Baker can place the biscuit cutter fully on it.

The question:
Given the length of a side of the starting DoughSquare, and the diameter of the biscuit cutter, how many more biscuits can a Frugal Baker cut-out than a Wasteful Baker?
Input
Line 1: Two floats side and diameter separated by a space
Output
Line 1: How many more biscuits a Frugal Baker makes than a Wasteful Baker
Constraints
0 < diameter < side < 100
Example
Input
3 1
Output
2
