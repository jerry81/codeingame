# leftovers
- we have not used the new skill choosing algorithm

# new feature
- applications may be bigger
- adjacent or same skill desk, must give card of choosing
- use skill - (if option available) - uses skill card in hand
  - training (0) - draw 2 more cards but can only play one extra card (5 total) (one-time)
  - architecture(4) - (permanent) - draw an extra card, cumulative 
  - refactoring(7) - remove one tech debt (one time)
  - code review(6) - 2 bonus skills into discard pile (one time)

# new strategy
- give priority to smaller applications
- don't move to where the opponent is (+ or - 1 block)
- use skills
