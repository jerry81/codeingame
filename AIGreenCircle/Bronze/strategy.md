# leftovers
- just started playing skill card logic 

# new feature
- applications may be bigger
- 2 skills lost each time you "pass go" (7 to 0)
- MOVE now has new option MOVE {place} {card to take} 
  - if your reach has increased 

# new strategy
- minimize number of times you pass go - just grab the next available desk that doesn't "disturb"

- delayed release (build draw/discard with architecture farming)

- PLAY_CARD phase
- Prioritize the play_cards (descending) - done

- further optimize continuous integration and task prioritization 

- minimize damage from THROW

# fixes

- first add the missing enums - card locations - done
